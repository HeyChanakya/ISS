For the first line there isn't a colon after function definition.
In the next few lines the assignment operator is wrong. They have given an equal to compare operator instead of an assignment operator. So change == to =.
In the next line they have given three asterix *** instead of two asterix ** for the power operator. So we have to change *** to **.
In the next definition of the function there isn't a colon as well as a comma between parameters.
In this function the for and if don't have a colon.
In these lines the function names called are wrong  so change them so that they match it.
